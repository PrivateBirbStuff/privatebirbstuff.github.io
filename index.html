            <h2>Harpy Jobs</h2>
            <p>You can give your harpy a job. Why? Because you said so. And because you might need more income. Your harpy may not like it much though. Each Harpy species has Synergies and Anergies, that's to say it's good at some jobs, and less good at other. Synergies provide a 25% bonus, while Anergies provide a 25% loss.</p>

            <p>Before finalising your decision, keep in mind that choosing 2 of the biggest options or 3 of the second-biggest will cause your harpy to be flightless if she isn't already by default.</p>
